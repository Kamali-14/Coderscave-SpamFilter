# Spam Email Filter using NLP and Machine Learning

## Overview
This project aims to develop a robust Spam Email Filter using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms. The goal is to create an intelligent system capable of accurately classifying emails as either spam or legitimate (ham) based on their content and linguistic features.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the spam email filter comprises a collection of labeled emails, with each email categorized as either spam or ham.

## Preprocessing
The preprocessing phase involves cleaning and standardizing the text data to prepare it for further analysis. This includes removing HTML tags, stopwords, punctuation, and performing tokenization and stemming.

## Modeling
In the modeling phase, machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression are trained on the labeled dataset to build a classification model.

## Evaluation
The performance of the trained spam email filter is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The model is tested on a separate validation dataset to assess its generalization ability and effectiveness in classifying spam and ham emails.

## Conclusion
The development of the Spam Email Filter using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms marks a significant milestone in addressing the persistent issue of spam emails. By leveraging advanced NLP methods and powerful machine learning models, we have created an intelligent system capable of accurately classifying emails as either spam or legitimate (ham) based on their content and linguistic features.
